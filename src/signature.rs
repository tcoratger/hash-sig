/// Defines the interface for a **synchronized signature scheme**.
///
/// ## Overview
///
/// In a synchronized (or stateful) signature scheme, keys are associated with a fixed
/// lifetime, which is divided into discrete time periods called **epochs**. A key pair
/// is restricted to signing only once per epoch. Reusing an epoch to sign a
/// different message or even the same message again will compromise the security of the scheme.
///
/// This model is particularly well-suited for consensus protocols like Ethereum's
/// proof-of-stake (lean Ethereum), where validators sign messages
/// (e.g., block proposals or attestations) at regular, predetermined intervals.
///
/// ## Theoretical Foundation
///
/// This trait abstracts the family of post-quantum signature schemes presented in
/// "Hash-Based Multi-Signatures for Post-Quantum Ethereum" [DKKW25a] and its
/// extension "LeanSig for Post-Quantum Ethereum". These schemes are variants of
/// the **eXtended Merkle Signature Scheme (XMSS)**, which builds a many-time signature
/// scheme from a one-time signature (OTS) primitive and a Merkle tree.
pub trait SignatureScheme {
    /// The public key used for verification.
    ///
    /// The key must be serializable to allow for network transmission and storage.
    type PublicKey: Serialize + DeserializeOwned;

    /// The secret key used for signing.
    ///
    /// The key must be serializable for persistence and secure backup.
    type SecretKey: Serialize + DeserializeOwned;

    /// The signature object produced by the signing algorithm.
    type Signature: Serialize + DeserializeOwned;

    /// The maximum number of epochs supported by this signature scheme configuration,
    /// denoted as $L$ in the literature.
    ///
    /// This constant defines the total size of the address space for one-time signatures,
    /// corresponding to the number of leaves in the underlying Merkle tree. While this is
    /// the maximum possible lifetime, an individual key pair can be generated to be active
    /// for a shorter, specific range of epochs within this total lifetime using the
    /// `key_gen` function.
    ///
    /// This value **must** be a power of two to ensure a balanced binary Merkle tree structure.
    const LIFETIME: u64;

    /// Generates a new cryptographic key pair.
    ///
    /// This function creates a fresh public key for verifying signatures and a

    ///
    /// ### Active Range
    ///
    /// The generated key pair is configured to be active only for a specific sub-range
    /// of its total `LIFETIME`. This is a practical optimization for key management,
    /// allowing a single cryptographic setup to support keys with different lifespans.
    ///
    /// The active period covers all epochs in the range
    /// `activation_epoch..activation_epoch + num_active_epochs`.
    ///
    /// ### Parameters
    /// * `rng`: A cryptographically secure random number generator.
    /// * `activation_epoch`: The starting epoch for which this key is active.
    /// * `num_active_epochs`: The number of consecutive epochs for which this key is active.
    ///
    /// ### Returns
    /// A tuple containing the new `(PublicKey, SecretKey)`.

    /// This method cryptographically binds a message to the signer's identity for a
    /// single, unique epoch. Callers must ensure they never call this function twice
    /// with the same secret key and for the same epoch, as this would compromise security.
    /// The signing process may be probabilistic.
    ///
    /// ### Parameters
    /// * `rng`: A random number generator, required for signature schemes that use
    ///   probabilistic components.
    /// * `sk`: A reference to the secret key to be used for signing.
    /// * `epoch`: The specific epoch for which the signature is being created.
    /// * `message`: A fixed-size byte array representing the message to be signed.
    ///
    /// ### Returns
    /// A `Result` which is:
    /// * `Ok(Self::Signature)` on success, containing the generated signature.
    /// * `Err(SigningError)` on failure.
